# Electronic voting system using blockchain
An electronic voting system that uses the blockchain technology and that can be used by the École de Technologie Supérieure (ÉTS) for voting on things like the election of officers of the Student Association (AÉÉTS) or in referendums.

## Release

Master's projects have a deadline, so I had to rush the delivery of the project. Release was planned to be done once the project was approoved, but now I need to clean up everything and organize it so that others can contribute to the project.
Expect it to be available here before the end of July, 2022.
