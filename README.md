# Electronic voting system using blockchain
A completely open source electronic voting system that uses the blockchain technology and that can be used by the École de Technologie Supérieure (ÉTS) for voting on things like the election of officers of the Student Association (AÉÉTS) or in referendums.

## Release

Master's projects have a deadline, so the project was released before the deadline without the measures needed to make it pubicly available. These measures were waiting the approval of the project, but once it was aprooved the author started working on something else straight away and still didn't have time to prepare the release.

Expect it to be eventually available here.
